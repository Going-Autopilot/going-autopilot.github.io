$name screams, &quot;IT&#39;S NERF OR NOTHING!&quot; 

$She hops over the table and grabs the paper airplane with nerf guns for wings. $She rips off both guns and throws one at the art professor. The professor snatches the gun out of the air. She knows the assignment.

The nerf guns were loaded. Pandemonium ensues as the two try to attack one another. The STEM event gets shut down. $name walks back to $her_his dorm alone that night.

The group plays a few other games, and $name wins a game of Scrabble by two points. At the end of the night, everyone is tuckered out. They thank Dijon for hosting the board game night, who says there will be another one sometime next week. 

As $name goes to leave Dijon&#39;s dorm, he pulls $her aside.

$She strikes up conversations with random strangers. $She wonders how many of them will remember tonight. Not many, $she resolves. One of the guests challenges $her to a dance battle.

Hazel saunters up to $name and mumbles something to $her. She looks $her dead in the eye.

$name and the rest of the movie-goers quietly watch the film. They laugh at the funny parts and make fun of the romantic parts. Overall, $she gives the movie a 6/10. The ending was pretty good, but the exposition was quite boring. The sound effects didn&#39;t age well, either. 

When the movie ends, Hazel puts on the sequel. That got a 7/10 for sure. The character development was much better, although the love interest was too predictable.

When that movie ends, Hazel plays the prequel. The prequel was the worst one of the lot. It was too gimmicky and focused too much on foreshadowing the events of the first movie. 4/10.

While $name ran to the bathroom, Hazel did not. 

Hazel&#39;s body shuts down, and she collapses to the floor. Unsure of what to do, $name props Hazel onto the couch and races out the door. $She does not stop until $she makes it to $her_his dorm.

Just then, $her_his eyes captivate on alley 4. There&#39;s a group of two people. One of them exudes a weird sense of familiarity. There&#39;s an aura of both fascination and somberness to his stature. Is $she in love, or is there something else afoot? Maybe it&#39;s love. What&#39;s $her_his sexual preferences, anyway? 

The other person in the group is really ugly.
