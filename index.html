$She strikes up conversations with random strangers. $She wonders how many of them will remember tonight. Not many, $she resolves. One of the guests challenges $her to a dance battle.

Whatever Hazel said sounded like a joke, so $name laughs. Hazel frowns, then disappears. 

After a while, the party wraps up, and the guests clear out. Some of them thank Hazel for hosting the party.

&quot;Yes, it is.&quot;
&quot;$name, let&#39;s go to a video game tournament. It&#39;s the same one from last week.&quot;
&quot;We&#39;re past that, Dijon.&quot;

Hazel turns to $name and says, &quot;Wanna come with some people to my apartment and watch a movie?&quot;

$name and the rest of the movie-goers quietly watch the film. They laugh at the funny parts and make fun of the romantic parts. Overall, $she gives the movie a 6/10. The ending was pretty good, but the exposition was quite boring. The sound effects didn&#39;t age well, either. 

When the movie ends, Hazel puts on the sequel. That got a 7/10 for sure. The character development was much better, although the love interest was too predictable.

When that movie ends, Hazel plays the prequel. The prequel was the worst one of the lot. It was too gimmicky and focused too much on foreshadowing the events of the first movie. 4/10.

$name gets bored during the reboot (5/10) and completely falls asleep by the start of the spin-off Christmas special (9/10). Which was a real shame because it was a classic.
